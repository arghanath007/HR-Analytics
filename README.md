# AtliQ-HR-Analytics-Dashboard

>This was a Project series put up by a YouTuber Codebasics, in which he discussed a real life workflow in creating an HR report for an HR person in a real world company AtliQ. He showed up from loading the data, to cleaning/transforming the data, learning about the KPIs needed by the HR person of the company.

## Problem Statement

> The problem for the company was that they were in a hybrid mode of working i.e some employees are coming to office to work and some are working from home. They wanted insights on the Attendance/Presence of the employees for their past **3** months of data.

* Some of their concers were:

1. Knowing the percentage presence of employees
2. Working Preferences, either work from home or coming to work
3. Knowing how many people are taking sick leaves.

## My Work

> I have learned a lot from working though it. My experience would be to make a **new one from scratch** and outline all of the things that I understand from looking at the data and what insights should I give as a Data Analyst to the company to improve their overall working of the company and increase their efficiency as well.
