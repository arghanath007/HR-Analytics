> I searched for some HR Analytics logos to look for a theme and found one.

* Theme Color -> <#0089b3>, <rgb(0, 137, 179)>, <hsl(194, 100%, 35%)>

> Use a good website to generate more colors which matches this color scheme.

> Open PowerPoint and create a new slide. Select an empty slide and pick a rectangle shape, make it the size of the slide. From the above color palette, pick the main color and fill the shape with that color. Remove the borders as well. Paste the logo into the slide and the heading of the report as well. Save the slide as a picture and use it as a background image in PowerBI.
